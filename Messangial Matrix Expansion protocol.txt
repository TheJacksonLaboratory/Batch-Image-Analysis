Messangial Matrix ExpansionAfter euthanasia the left kidney was cut in half along the sagittal plane and and placed in 4%PFA in PBS for 24 hours at room temperature.  The kidneys were then embed in paraffin and sectioned in 4-5 M sections which were then stained with periodic acid schiff (PAS) stain and counter stained with hematoxylin using a Leica autostainer XL ST5020. The slides were then scanned with a  nanozoomer slide scanner (Hamamatsu, 2.0HT).  Images were then captured at 40x and rotated freely to be in roughly all the same orientation resulting in a field of view of 245 m x 433 m.  A starting point was randomly defined on the upper left and a grid pattern was used moving towards the right to a new view with 100% change of view.   An alternating pattern of capture, skip, repeat was used until 50 glomeruli that were fully captured within predetermined capture fields.   Analysis of MME was then performed using Imagej Version 2.0.0-rc-43/1.50g.  Briefly, regions of interest were defined by manually outlining the capillary tuft, and the area of the tuft was obtained.  The image was then optically switched to HSB (hue,saturation brightness).  The saturation channel was thresholded for “pinkness” and the percentage of stained material per glomeruli was calculated. This process was automated using a macro script can be found https://github.com/susan-sheehan/MME.   Saturation levels are batch dependent, in this study each age cohort was stained as a batch, the following settings were used (6 month Saturation 90-255, 12 month 80-255 and 18 month 90-255). A linear mixed effect model is then used to further analyze the data for differences between groups, this was done using R.
